1. We need to configure the admin portion of our Django project. Create a new superuser so we can login! Follow the prompts after typing the command below:
```bash
./python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Now we can start the server again with `python manage.py runserver` and then navigate to the admin page http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin. Use your newly-created superuser credentials to login.

The admin homepage should look like this now:
